# Architecture of STC-app

This document captures the architecture of the Smart Trash Can Application (STC-app), using the arc42 template.

# Introduction and Goals

This app helps people to put their trash into the right bin, by analyzing the trash with their smartphone camera.

## Requirements Overview

> 💡 **Requirements IDs** can be generated by some tools, and indeed we do that with the other case studies. In this project, we create them by hand, because we are pragmatic, not religious.


Essential Features

* **R-01**: Classify trash correctly with smartphone camera
* **R-02**:Identify the correct bin for the identified trash, based on regional laws

Optional Features

* **R-03**: Generate printable labels with QR-Codes that the user can fix to a trash area, to allow app to identify it.
* **R-04**: Order replacement trash bags via the app.

## Quality Goals

  Quality Goal | Reason
--- | ---
**R-06**: Code and documentation follows best practices, no shortcuts. | Main purpose of this project is the book, not the trash
**R-07**: App works directly after installation. | Low-friction user experience
**R-08**: Number of uses is limited, until the user either pays or provides an AI API code. | We need some kind of cost control, and do not want to use ads to finance the app.

## Stakeholders

Role/Name   | Contact        | Expectations
---|---|---
Person with trash | | Low-friction help for recycling trash correctly.
Reader | | Concepts in the book become more understandable by a working example.
| Book author | Michael | Creating this product leads to better and more consistent content of the *Product Velocity* book.

# Architecture Constraints

* Works on all smartphones.
* Requires user to provide their own GPT API code.

# Solution Strategy

> 💡 **C4 Model** We want to use a C4 model for our architecture. However, gitHub rendering (mermaid) has only limited C4 support. We have to make a trade-off between (1) pretty rendering, but not having a single source, (2) ugly rendering and single source, or (3) pretty rendering, but not being 100% C4-compliant. This is option (3).

### System Context

The C4 System Context diagram visualizes everything our system (the STC) is interacting with. It defines the system's scope by showing who uses it, what external services it depends on, and how it fits into the broader environment. This helps establish clear boundaries and shared understanding early in the design process. Note that you can form sentences by following the arrows:

```
User → physically disposes trash into → bins
```

    %% Nodes
    user(["👤 User<br/><small>A person with trash in front of recycling bins</small>"])

    bins(["Bins<br/><small>Recycling bins (region-specific) for various classes of trash</small>"])
    server(["AI API Server<br/><small>External classification service</small>"])

    user -->|physically disposes trash into | bins

    stc -->|requests user authentication from | oauth
```

### Container View

The C4 Container diagram zooms into the STC system to show its internal structure. It illustrates the major building blocks—called containers—such as the web app, backend server, and database, and explains how they interact. This level of detail clarifies how responsibilities are split across components and how data flows through the system. 

We add additional technical information. In addition to the verbal description, for Containers we add types and technologies (e.g. MongoDB), and for relationships we add protocols (e.g. JSON/HTTPS).


```mermaid

    %% External Actors
    user(["👤 User<br/><small>【Person】<br/>Interacts with the client app</small>"])
    trash(["Trash<br/><small>【Physical Item】<br/>Unsorted Trash</small>"])
    oauth(["OAuth Provider<br/><small>【Cloud Service】<br/>Auth0 used for user authentication</small>"])
    serverAI(["AI Server<br/><small>【Cloud Service】<br/>GPT API used for trash classification</small>"])
