# Architecture of STC-app

This document captures the architecture of the Smart Trash Can Application (STC-app), using the arc42 template.

# Introduction and Goals

This app helps people to put their trash into the right bin, by analyzing the trash with their smartphone camera.

## Requirements Overview

> ðŸ’¡ **Requirements IDs** can be generated by some tools, and indeed we do that with the other case studies. In this project, we create them by hand, because we are pragmatic, not religious.


Essential Features

* **R-01**: Classify trash correctly with smartphone camera
* **R-02**:Identify the correct bin for the identified trash, based on regional laws

Optional Features

* **R-03**: Generate printable labels with QR-Codes that the user can fix to a trash area, to allow app to identify it.
* **R-04**: Order replacement trash bags via the app.

## Quality Goals

  Quality Goal | Reason
--- | ---
**R-06**: Code and documentation follows best practices, no shortcuts. | Main purpose of this project is the book, not the trash
**R-07**: App works directly after installation. | Low-friction user experience
**R-08**: Number of uses is limited, until the user either pays or provides an AI API code. | We need some kind of cost control, and do not want to use ads to finance the app.

## Stakeholders

Role/Name   | Contact        | Expectations
---|---|---
Person with trash | | Low-friction help for recycling trash correctly.
Reader | | Concepts in the book become more understandable by a working example.
| Book author | Michael | Creating this product leads to better and more consistent content of the *Product Velocity* book.

# Architecture Constraints

* Works on all smartphones.
* Requires user to provide their own GPT API code.
