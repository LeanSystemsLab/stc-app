# Smart Trash Can Application (STC-app)

This project represents a case study from the Book **Product Velocity**.
Learn more at [productvelocity.org](https://www.productvelocity.org).

## Introduction

**Ava:** “Hey, where do I put the pizza box? Regular garbage or paper?”

**Ben:** “Neither. It goes into *Food & Yard Waste*.”

**Ava:** “What? That does not make any sense! It's neither food nor yard waste!”

**Carlos:** “That's Texas for you. In California, it’d go into *Compost*.”

**Ava:** “That's only slightly better. I would have put it into the paper bin.”

**Ben:** “Nah, you never do that. Sometimes you have to throw it into regular trash, like in New York.”

**Ava:** “That's crazy. How can anybody recycle correctly? We need to change this. **Let's develop an app for it!**”

## Is this a hardware product?

Even though we are developing an app, we have to take hardware into account: At a minimum, the smart phone camera, but there will be more.

This is the smallest case study from [Product Velocity](https://www.productvelocity.org). We include it so that

1. We better understand why software development is so blazingly fast these days;
2. We understand that even for "pure software" product, we need to take the hardware that it's running on into account.

## Read the book for details

This is a showcase project. So we will demonstrate best practices from the book in a fashion that will not slow us down. In this gitHub repository, we will capture artefacts, decisions and so forth. We will only briefly explain what we are doing and provide references to the book, where you can read the details.
